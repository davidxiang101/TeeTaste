# TeeTaste
ðŸ‘•ðŸš€ An AI-powered T-shirt and Sneaker recommendation engine built with NextJS, Django and TensorFlow.

## Overview
TeeTaste is a personalized T-shirt and Sneaker recommendation engine. It allows users to vote between two T-shirts, and based on the user's preferences, it will recommend a new pair of T-shirts to vote on. The aim is to create a more interactive and personalized shopping experience for T-shirt enthusiasts and Sneaker heads, reducing the cognitive load of choosing from hundreds of T-shirts.

The motivation behind this project is to use modern machine learning techniques to enhance the user's shopping experience by creating a recommendation system based on a user's individual tastes and preferences. It is designed to be an enjoyable and interactive way of discovering new T-shirts without having to manually search through the entire product catalog.

## How TeeTaste Finds Similar T-Shirts

TeeTaste uses a combination of machine learning techniques to provide a fun and interactive way to discover T-shirts that match your taste. The following is a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Feature Extraction**:

   TeeTaste uses a technique known as feature extraction to represent each T-shirt image as a numerical vector. It does this by leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model called ResNet.

   ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been trained on a massive dataset (ImageNet). It has learned to recognize various low-level features (like lines, curves, colors) and high-level features (like shapes, objects) from this dataset.

   We use ResNet to process each of our T-shirt images. The output is a feature vector that represents the key visual characteristics of the T-shirt. These feature vectors serve as input for the next step.
   
2. **Cosine Similarity**:

   Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0, Ï€] radians. 

   It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors at 90Â° have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. 

   By using cosine similarity, we can effectively determine how similar two T-shirts are based on their visual features.

3. **Approximate Nearest Neighbors**:

   After transforming all T-shirt images into feature vectors, we want to find the ones that are most similar to a selected T-shirt. For this, we use a technique called Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN).

   ANN allows us to quickly search through our dataset for vectors that are close to a given vector. The way we determine "closeness" is by using a measure called cosine similarity.

   By setting up ANN with additional trees, we can make ANN more precise that it would be with just one tree. We can adjust the number of trees in our ANN to determine how similar our reommendations should be to the user's selections.

In this way, TeeTaste combines these techniques to provide an interactive tool that adapts to your T-shirt preferences and provides increasingly tailored recommendations.
